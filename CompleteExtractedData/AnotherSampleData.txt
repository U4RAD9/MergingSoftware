Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)
ESR - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate
MODIFIED WESTERGREN
12 mm/hr 0 - 10
Interpretation:
ESR is also known as Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate. An ESR test is used to assess inflammation in the body. Many conditions can cause an
abnormal ESR, so an ESR test is typically used with other tests to diagnose and monitor different diseases. An elevated ESR may occur in
inflammatory conditions including infection, rheumatoid arthritis ,systemic vasculitis, anemia, multiple myeloma , etc. Low levels are typically
seen in congestive heart failure, polycythemia ,sickle cell anemia, hypo fibrinogenemia , etc.

Blood Group ABO & Rh Typing
Blood Group B
Rh Factor Positive
Interpretation:
Interpreting the results of a blood group test involves understanding the ABO blood group and Rh factor results. We can interpret them as
follows:
ABO Blood Grouping:
Blood Group A: Has A antigens on red blood cells and anti-B antibodies in the plasma.
Blood Group B: Has B antigens on red blood cells and anti-A antibodies in the plasma.
Blood Group AB: Has both A and B antigens on red blood cells and no anti-A or anti-B antibodies in the plasma.
Blood Group O: Has no A or B antigens on red blood cells but has both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the plasma.
Rh Typing:
Rh-positive: Indicates the presence of the Rh antigen (D antigen) on red blood cells.
Rh-negative: Indicates the absence of the Rh antigen on red blood cells.
Interpreting your blood group involves identifying which antigens are present on your red blood cells (A, B, or both) and whether you are Rhpositive or Rh-negative. For example, if your blood group is A-positive, it means you have A antigens and Rh antigen on your red blood cells.
Knowing your blood group is important for medical purposes, such as blood transfusions, organ transplants, and during pregnancy to prevent
potential complications related to blood compatibility.

Interpretation:
URINALYSIS- Routine urine analysis assists in screening and diagnosis of various metabolic, urological, kidney and liver disorders.
Protein: Elevated proteins can be an early sign of kidney disease. Urinary protein excretion can also be temporarily elevated by strenuous
exercise, orthostatic proteinuria, dehydration, urinary tract infections and acute illness with fever ....

Glucose: Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can lead to presence of glucose in urine. Other causes include pregnancy, hormonal disturbances,
liver disease and certain medications.
Ketones: Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can lead to presence of ketones in urine. Ketones can also be seen in starvation, frequent vomiting,
pregnancy and strenuous exercise.
Blood: Occult blood can occur in urine as intact erythrocytes or haemoglobin, which can occur in various urological, nephrological and bleeding
disorders.
Leukocytes: An increase in leukocytes is an indication of inflammation in urinary tract or kidneys. Most common cause is bacterial urinary tract
infection.
Nitrite: Many bacteria give positive results when their number is high. Nitrite concentration during infection increases with length of time the
urine specimen is retained in bladder prior to collection.
pH: The kidneys play an important role in maintaining acid base balance of the body. Conditions of the body producing acidosis/ alkalosis or
ingestion of certain type of food can affect the pH of urine.
Specific gravity: Specific gravity gives an indication of how concentrated the urine is. Increased specific gravity is seen in conditions like
dehydration, glycosuria and proteinuria while decreased specific gravity is seen in excessive fluid intake, renal failure and diabetes insipidus.
Bilirubin: In certain liver diseases such as biliary obstruction or hepatitis, bilirubin gets excreted in urine.
Urobilinogen: Positive results are seen in liver diseases like hepatitis and cirrhosis and in cases of haemolytic anaemia.
