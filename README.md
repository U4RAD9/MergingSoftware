This is the Updated Merging Software. 
I've fixed the following things as of 23rd September 2024 :
1. Fixed the renaming of Blood Reports, ECG Reports , and PFT too.
2. Fixed the merging of all the files of a particular patient including the Dr. consultation file and the Smart Reporting File.
3. Fixed the splitting logic , added both the dr.consultation file and the smart report.
4. Now , I have to add the logic which checks the formatting issue in ecg files and then they upload it to bot.

* To run the merging software i have to use : py merge_pdfs.py
* To create the .exe i have to simply run : pyinstaller merge_pdfs.spec
